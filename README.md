SpaceWire network technology is intended to be used for communication onboard spacecraft. It has been designed to connect sensors, processing units, memory devices and different onboard systems. The objective of this study is to implement an FPGA-based device, specifically using the AVNET Ultra96-V2 development board, that is capable of sending and receiving data using the SpaceWire communications protocol. It describes the key features of SpaceWire and verifies that the implemented SpaceWire transmitter and receiver are working properly using the SpaceWire Link Analyser Mk3 development tool, a SpaceWire link analyzer from Star-Dundee that allows to monitor the traffic over a SpaceWire network. The result is a device suitable for testing and validation of a SpaceWire communications bus, which follows the ESA ECCS-E50-12A standard.
